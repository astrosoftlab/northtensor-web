Hello and welcome to the guide on how to purchase TAO on MEXC using a mobile phone.
We are glad to have so many allies, enemies, and friends in the community who are interested in purchasing TAO. Navigating the cryptocurrency market can be like navigating the maze of the legendary Minotaur; it can seem complex and even a bit scary at times. However, just as the Greek hero Theseus was able to navigate this labyrinth with the help of Ariadne's thread, we're here to provide you with a similar thread of guidance, making your journey to purchase TAO on MEXC a straightforward and successful venture. So gather your courage, pick up your thread, and let's delve into the labyrinth together, confident in our shared journey towards success.


To purchase TAO and use it you will need `talisman.xyz` wallet. You can download it from [here](https://talisman.xyz/).
It's a web3 wallet that specifically supports `polkadot`.
While this guide can be followed using any adequate polkadot wallet. We've only tested using Talisman and Polkadot{js}. 
We highly recommend using the Talisman Wallet due to the ability to confirm transactions before signing as shown below.

We will be purchasing TAO using USDT (since it's the only market they offer) from mexc.com

To get started install the app from your app store and create an account, for reference go to this page: [https://www.mexc.com/download](https://www.mexc.com/download)
