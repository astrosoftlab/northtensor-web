# Overview

Currently, $TAO is geoblocked on MEXC in certain markets including the US. While this is an inconvenience, it is only temporary. In order to bypass the geoblocking for the time being, a VPN is required.


## Recommended VPNs

There are a tons of options for VPNs, here are some that we recommened.

	Mullvad is a cheap (~$5.50 per month) anonymous & crypto-friendly VPN service that is privacy centric, allowing you to make an account with one click. In addition to normal payment methods, they also accept Monero, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash.
  
2. [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/)
