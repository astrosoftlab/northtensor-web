# Overview

Currently, $TAO is geoblocked on MEXC in certain markets including the US. While this is an inconvenience, it is only temporary. In order to bypass the geoblocking for the time being, a VPN is required.


## Recommended VPNs

If you don't already have a VPN, here are a few that come highly recommended.
1. [Mullvad VPN](https://mullvad.net/en]) is a cheap (~$5.50 per month) anonymous and crypto-friendly VPN service that is privacy-centric, allowing you to create an account with just one click. In addition to normal payment methods, they also accept Monero, Bitcoin, and Bitcoin Cash.
  
2. [IVPN](https://www.ivpn.net/) is another crypto-friendly VPN service that allows for weekly subscriptions starting at $2 per week. They accept normal methods of payment as well as Monero and Bitcoin.

### What's Next?

After creating an account with your VPN provider of choice, connect to a new location (we recommend Singapore) and follow the same steps outlined in our other guide [here](https://northtensor.ai/docs/purchase-tao) to make a purchase on MEXC.
