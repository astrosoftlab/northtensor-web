# Overview
We're community focused. We know that if Bittensor isn't widely utilized and understood by creators, it won't be successful. We're building tools and documentation to make it easy for developers to integrate Bittensor into their apps, and encouraging the community to do the same. Our hope is that by providing what we know those benefitting from our work can give back and provide what they've learned for a more robust and useful network of collaborators and users.


## Bounty Program
We're launching a bounty program to encourage developers to build on Bittensor and share their journey. We'll be releasing more details on this soon.


## North Tensor API
Our API will abstract out the Bittensor complexity into a simple interface. This will allow users to quickly get started with integrating Bittensor into their apps.
