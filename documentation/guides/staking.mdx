## Staking {#staking}

#### Mobile Staking Note

```
Using the Nova Wallet App the process should be identical.
The only difference is how you navigate to the Northtensor website.
You'll need to open the browser page within the Nova App
to have access to your wallet functionality.
```

Go to [Wallet](/wallet) and follow the images below to stake your TAO.

1. On first connection the page will ask you to connect your wallet. Select the appropriate wallet and then click `Connect`.

   This amount should increase daily as the network rewards are distributed.
