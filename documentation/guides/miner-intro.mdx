# Overview
Miners drive the network forward. They are the ones that are responsible for creating the intelligence that the network uses to solve problems and earn half the emissions for the work.
Mining requires large amounts of resources, intelligence, tenacity, and patience. It is not for the faint of heart. However, the rewards are worth the effort.
We hope to help miners through documentation, tools, and community support. We want to make it easy for anyone to get started mining, and we want to make it easy for miners to get the most out of their mining experience.

## Mining Guides
We'll have some mining guides to get you up and running with mining soon.
Feel free to reach out if you feel you already have some good steps you want to share, we'd be happy to reward you for the efforts.

## Mining Tools
We have several ideas the speed up everything from finetuning, through deployment, to tracking emissions from an easy to use dashboard. 
We'll provide more details on these after we get the basics up and running.
