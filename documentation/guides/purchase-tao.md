To purchase TAO and use it you will need `talisman.xyz` wallet. You can download it from [here](https://talisman.xyz/).
It's a web3 wallet that specifically supports `polkadot`.
While this guide can be followed using any adequate polkadot wallet. We've only tested using Talisman and Polkadot{js}. 
We highly recommend using the Talisman Wallet due to the ability to confirm transactions before signing as shown below.  

&nbsp;

We will be purchasing TAO using USDT (since it's the only market they offer) from mexc.com--create an account [here](https://www.mexc.com/register).
