## What is Bittensor?

#### Bittensor is the Bitcoin of Artificial Intelligence.

Just as the Bitcoin protocol distributes Bitcoin to miners for running hashes to secure the transactional network,
Bittensor distributes TAO to miners for running Machine Learning Models that provide more intelligence to the network.
The more intelligence you contribute, the more Tao you earn.

#### You can also earn Tao through Staking.

Tao can also be earned through Validators that confirm miners are responding with real answers, the reward for Validators running this operation is shared across those that Stake with them.
Your staking Tao with North Tensor means the protocol sends rewards to your wallet directly.
