# Overview
If you're on a desktop computer, we recommend the [Talisman wallet](https://www.talisman.xyz/) to store and use your Tao.
This is a general usage guide for using Tao on the Talisman wallet.

Overall, this guide will walk you through how to:
- Install Talisman wallet on a support web browser
- Create a new wallet
- Backup your recovery phrase
- Adjust Talisman permissions to allow interaction on websites
- Identifying your Bittensor Wallet address to receive Tao

Warning, we're not responsible for any loss of funds or mistakes made while using the Talisman wallet. This guide is solely informational and accurate as of publishing.

## Extension Installation

The Talisman wallet Extension is available for Chrome, Brave, Arc, Firefox, and Edge

To Install, navigate to [https://www.talisman.xyz/download](https://www.talisman.xyz/download) to be routed to the appropriate webstore.
Follow the instructions for your browser to install the extension. 

Once you install the extension you'll be able to set up your wallet. 

It's important to note that Talisman will auto generate a wallet named "My Polkadot Account" and "My Ethereum Account"
While these are valid wallets and can be used, we recommend creating new custom wallets with personalized account names. 
If you don't want to create new wallets, you can always rename the existing wallets. 

## New Wallet Set-up

1. Select New Wallet

## Recovery Phrase Backup
It is vital to keep your recovery phrase stored in a secure location. 
This recovery phrase will provide access to accounts and funds in those accounts. 
**DO NOT SHARE THIS RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE.**

If you lose this recovery phrase you will lose any future access to your Tao.
If someone else gets this recovery phrase they will have access to your Tao.

From the Profile Page
1. Navigate to Settings

2. Select Backup Wallet
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

5. Optionally mark that you've saved it, this will suppress reminders from Talisman to back it up.

Now that you've backed up your recovery phrase, you can use it to restore your wallet on any device with the Talisman extension in the future.
So if your laptop is destroyed or you get a new computer, you can restore your wallet to the new device without loss of funds.

## Allowing Sites
Allowing sites access to your Talisman wallet gives the site information about the Bittensor wallets you have stored, without sharing the ability to send or spend. Enabling trustworthy sites, such as NorthTensor.ai to simplify staking or transfers.

Allowing sites does not give the site access to your recovery phrase nor password (any site that asks for either are scams). 
Allowing sites does enable the site to request transactions which can be approved with a password and confirmation in the Talisman app.

NorthTensor.ai will use this functionality to simplify staking with us on our [wallet page](https://northtensor.ai/wallet)

To manage trusted sites
1. Navigate to settings

2. Select Trusted Sites

3. Select the site you want to manage and choose which wallets it can see
