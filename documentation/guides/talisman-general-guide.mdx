## Extension Installation

The Talisman wallet Extension is available for Chrome, Brave, Arc, Firefox, and Edge

Once you install the extension you'll be able to set up your wallet. 

It's important to note that Talisman will auto generate a wallet named "My Polkadot Account" and "My Ethereum Account"
While these are valid wallets and can be used, we recommend creating new custom wallets with personlized account names. 
If you don't want to create new wallets, you can always rename the existing wallets. 

## New Wallet Set-up

1. Select New Wallet
&nbsp;

## Recovery Phrase Backup
It's vital to keep your recovery phrase stored in a secure location. 
This recovery phrase will provide access to accounts and funds in those accounts. 
DO NOT SHARE THIS RECOVERY PHRASE WITH ANYONE. 
If you lose this recovery phrase, along with access to your Talisman wallet 
(Losing access to your computer), you will lose any future access to your Tao.

From the Profile Page
1. Navigate to Settings

2. Select Backup Wallet
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

3. Provide the password you created when you initialized Talisman
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

4. Save your recovery phrase in a secure location. 
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

5. Mark that you've saved it. (So Talisman doesn't bug you about saving it on a future date)

## Allowing Sites
Many sites that are built to interact with the Bittensor network will need access to your Talisman wallet. 
The North Tensor Wallet app is one such site. 

Allowing sites access to your Talisman wallet gives the site information about the coldkeys you have access to. 
Sites will often use these coldkeys to show you balance information in your wallet or staked to a delegate. 

Allowing access also gives the site permission to prepare transactions for you to sign. 

Allowing sites does not give the site access to your password nor mnemonic. 
Any transactions will require review and approval in the Talisman extension.

Using the North Tensor Wallet, we will build transactions for you to: 
- Stake to or Unstake from a delegate
- Transfer funds

Talisman will prompt for a confirmation from you to execute the transaction, usually requiring your password. 

To manage trusted sites
1. Navigate to settings

2. Select Trusted Sites

3. Select the site you want to manage and choose wich wallets it can see
