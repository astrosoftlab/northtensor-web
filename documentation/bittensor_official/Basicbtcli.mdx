# Basic btcli

Before you begin customizing your miner, it is useful to familiarize yourself with our``btcli`` commands. Btcli is a command line interface to interact with Bittensor, and commands are used to monitor miner performance, transfer Tao, regenerate keys, and run a miner. 

## Running a miner


```bash
btcli run
```

## Monitoring 

For an overview of all possible btcli commands, enter: 

```bash
btcli -h
```

For an overview of all possible flags, enter:

```bash
btcli help
```

For a complete list of all created keys, run: 

```bash
btcli list
```

Both the "overview" and "inspect" commands are used to monitor your miner performance: 

```bash
btcli overview 
```

``btcli overview`` will display the specifics of your progress in the network, and includes your UID, state (active or inactive), [stake](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#tao), [rank](src/../../nested/Glossary.md), [trust](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#trust), [consensus](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#consensus), [incentive](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#incentive), [dividends](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#dividends), and [emission](src/../../nested/Glossary.md#inflation). For more information about these performance indicators, refer to the ["Consensus Mechanism"](../nested/Mechanisms.md) section.

```bash
btcli inspect 
```
``btcli inspect`` will not display such a detailed analysis of your performance, but will allow you to see your key identifiers, fingerprints, network, balance, stake, and emission. 

## Transferring Tao
​
The "unstake" command will transfer Tao from a hotkey to your coldkey. 

```bash​
btcli unstake
```
​

The "stake" command will transfer Tao from your coldkey to a hotkey associated.

```bash​
btcli stake 
```
​


To expedite longer staking and unstaking operations, you can string these flags to ``btcli stake`` and ``btcli unstake``:
```bash
#stake or unstake from all hotkeys
--wallet.all_hotkeys 
#stake or unstake from a specific set of hotkeys
--wallet.hotkeys <>
#stake or unstake from all hotkeys while exluding a specific set of hotkeys
--wallet.exclude_hotkeys <>
#stake or unstake to a specific amount of stake on a hotkey
--max_stake <>
```
​

This command moves Tao between coldkeys. A .125 tao burn fee is applied.

```bash​
btcli transfer
```

## Key regeneration

If you lose access to your keys, they can be easily regenerated with the unique mnemonic device you were provided with upon initial creation. 


Regen a full coldkey:

```bash​
btcli regen_coldkey
```


To regen only the public portion of a coldkey:

```bash
btcli regen_coldkeypub --ss58 <>
```


Regen a hotkey:

```bash
btcli regen_hotkey
```


## Delegating

Nominate your hotkey as a delegate:

```bash
btcli nominate
```

Delegate stake to someone else's delegate hotkey:

```bash
btcli delegate
```

View a list of all delegate hotkeys:

```bash
btcli list_delegates
```

Show who you are delegating to:

```bash
btcli my_delegates
```
