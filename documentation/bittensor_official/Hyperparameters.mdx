## AdjustmentInterval

- The interval over which we calculate the rate of new peer registrations, if the rate exceeds **TargetRegistrationsPerInterval** then the POW difficulty is doubled.

## BondsMovingAverage

- The coefficient Î± representing the smoothing factor during the computation of the new Bonds matrix via an exponentially weighted moving average.

## ImmunityPeriod

- How many blocks a a hotkey is immune from deregistration after joining the network.

## Kappa

- The temperature of sigmoid activation function to regularize Trust and become Consensus. 

## MaxAllowedUids

- How many UIDs can be registered to the network at one time.

## MinAllowedWeights

- The lower limit on the number of non zero weights a Validator sets after each epoch. Increasing **MinAllowedWeights** increases the size of the consensus set: the number of peers with greater than 50% trust.

## TargetRegistrationsPerInterval

- The target number of registrations expected each block. If the number of registrants is greater than **TargetRegistrationsPerInterval**, the difficulty of the registration will double. If the number of registrants is less than **TargetRegistrationsPerInterval**, the difficulty of the registration will be halved.

## ValidatorBatchSize

- Determines the size of each validation request sent by Validators. Each validation request has consistent state [batch size, sequence length]. Increasing batch sizes forces increased load onto Servers forcing them to improve hardware.

## ValidatorEpochLength

- Determines the number of blocks per epoch for each Validator. This parameter controls how often each Validator will set its weights.

## ValidatorEpochsPerReset	

- When active, Validators can reset their local scoring storage and start scoring without previous history.

## ValidatorSequenceLen

- Determines the size of each validation request sent by Validators. Each validation request has a consistent state [batch size, sequence length]. Increasing sequence length forces increased load onto Servers forcing them to improve hardware.

## ValidatorExcludeQuantile

- Validators exclude from weight setting the lowest quantile or percentile performing Servers recorded locally.

## ScalingLawPower	

- Adjusts through a power coefficient the estimated number of model parameters.

## SynergyScalingLawPower

- Adjusts through a power coefficient the estimated number of model parameters due to synergy.
