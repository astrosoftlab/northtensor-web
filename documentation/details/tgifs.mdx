# TGIF 2023-1-10 it's been a year of expansion and there have been some pain points I think that you know focusing a little bit on the pain points it helps people understand especially if they've mined over the last year and one of one of the biggest pain points one of like the political battles with inside bit tensor has been around the uid count how many miners can we sustain at any one time and there's been a number of limitations around that because we run Yuma consensus and human consensus is limited to 4096 uids based on the size of the chain what we could sustain in the blockchain at any at any moment in time so Finney was designed to allow us to scale beyond that uid set horizontally and horizontally sorry horizontally and vertically as as you'll see in a bit but the major push for Finney was not to release two of the major updates we're going to talk about right here subnets and delegation these are the two add-ons the main thing for Finney was increasing the tensors degrees of freedom with inside of the web3 ecosystem so that we could integrate into into the polka dot world so that Tau could be moved across borders Finney is about bit tensor's freedom in web 3. freedom from centralized control so that we're no longer fully controlling the validator set and we're we're able to push the protocol outside of the hands of the foundation and into the web Beyond any individual's control hitting into polka dot getting in that that relay chain position that parachain is number one step for that we don't moving beyond a single validator set that work we control as a foundation means that there's no third parties it means that that the the the token can be moved across borders between chains without anybody getting in the way and these are really important because if we can if we can't allow Tau to be liquid if people can't choose how they want to use the token it no longer has market value with inside the web 3 ecosystem and it's that market that we're using to drive the creation of machine intelligence so that's Finney but where we are today is not quite the Finney that is connected into a decentralized ecosystem of the polka dot today we're just launching Rococo Finney Rococo which is a bit of a test Network and we did it early so that people would have time to prepare so people have time to prepare for these updates to the chain they know how to use them and they won't be sort of caught on surprise cards they won't be surprised when we launched the the chain in a month or so so what what are the major updates I think this is people are really excited about them so the number one one is sub networks we've been talking about this for a really long time subnet sub networks are basically just running multiple Nakamoto consensuses across the same chain so we can scale horizontally so that we have multiple networks and we've expanded the we've really increased the speed at which we can run human consensus allowing us to possibly scale up to 64 000 size networks so we will be able to have 4 000 scale networks multiples of them plus even 16k networks across the chain running concurrently this will mean that the inflation in bit tensor is split between these networks and this will affect the incentive that each miners each each Miner gets so there'll be a hard task of selecting where that inflation will go in and into which networks a little bit on that later when we get to delegation with sub networks we also introduce something called sub Network connect and I'm going to talk a little bit about this maybe even demo it partially at the end of the call where we have networks that are connected to each other so Nakamoto 4K was the was the original Network that many of you are familiar with we're going to open a Nakamoto registration network with 16 kuids that allows people to prove that they're worthy of entering the 4K Nakamoto by performing well on the registration Network it's a hierarchical hierarchical aspect similar to promotion or relegation Network promotion or relegation League yeah cool so so we can have a Nakamoto registration Network up to 16k uids this means that we're going to really reduce the difficulty and proof of work which was over the last year was all approved for it was who could push out the other users with that difficulty and less of a focus on was there was there minor actually performing well from a machine learning perspective and that obviously those two things were interplayed but by by filtering uids first with the Nakamoto registration network will be able to reduce the demand on pow and hopefully expand the machine learning side of the network sub networks also allow us to build hierarchies where we're working with different modalities this is really exciting you know Innovation for what we're doing a bit tensor because we're going to expand into different modality sub networks this is something that happened in q1 or Q2 will open up an image Network for for bit tensor but with sub network with subnetwork connect what we can also do is connect those modalities so we can have a text image Network that requires understanding of both image and text so we can push towards multi-modality through the incentive mechanism directly how people are registrating registering to the network so that sub network is really exciting and sub networks are all about scale it's about how can we scale bid tensor to more users to more domains and into multimodality AI how can we really showcase that we're not just solving only a single problem with text just around text but working on problems that any client wanted to come and use bit tensor for the way in which we'll select those modalities we don't really know right now we're just going to focus on the core ones image of text and audio and and and start there but potentially clients could come and ask for a Time series Network I know there have been some people in the in the community that have asked specifically for that it's really exciting for us to to expand the AI research that we're doing in in different dimensions of space within within the the industry right so this is more about the AI side about scaling Finney is about core web3 technology you know how are we launching ourselves into the ecosystem this is about scaling the compute power of the network how can we build bigger networks and really truly become a a neural internet delegation is our foray into autonomous organizations the ability for people to band together and work in bit tensor as groups so those that have used bit tensor before are pretty familiar with the coldkey hotkey structure in bit tensor we've expanded this very simply and that allowing people to stake their funds to hotkeys that are not their own this is totally trustless so if you stake funds to a hockey that's not your own you won't lose access to those funds you can always get them back they just don't you just can't use them in in validation but the hotkey that you stake them to owned by a particular other individual by another coldkey can use them and so we're making this distinction we're expanding the the potential for people to move Town in bit tensor so that we can build hierarchies or clusters of of of individuals that then can group their power and and use it with inside of a bit tensor over the last year a lot of people have come to the realization that they needed 1024 Tau in order to be a validator this is changing we we're no longer going to be picking a a raw value for the validator cutoff it's it's going to be based on the number of uids I'm sorry it's gonna be based on the stake of the the validators so we'll take probably the top 100 in Nakamoto 4 4K so it'll be 100 validators and so in order to validate with inside bit tensor or to participate in validation you'll have to delegate stake to to someone or have a top hundred key there's a number of reasons why we're doing this with delegation so delegation is effectively a liquid democracy where individuals can build organizations and move Tau around with inside the ecosystem and and let that towel be used to vote on things especially the direction of the incentive flow and with inside bit tensor so delegations delegation is our foray into what I would say is liquid democracy and it's also a way for us as a foundation to make Revenue as well as other groups of people with inside the ecosystem to to make Revenue because we've built in a flat rate of 18 as a take from the delegators so if there's a hundred thousand Tau delegated to one particular hotkey from another individual 18 of the emissions or the dividends from that that stake the hundred thousand stake will go to funding the organization we hope that people invest in in the foundation so that we can continue work and hire Engineers but we've made it specifically so that there's competition for ourselves anybody can build anybody can become a delegate and anybody can nominate stake or whatever they want in any piece in any splitting of that stake they want so this really hopefully integrates a little bit of competition at the at the I mean the beginnings of competition at the organizational scale for for bit tensor so delegations about organization you know it's an on-ramp for us for people so that they can begin validating without having to run a miter they can begin making dividends without running a minor it's a funding mechanism for the foundation and it's also a democratic tool it's a way for people to build rep to gather behind represent representatives and have those Representatives work for them in order to make the tensor move the way that they want them to so those are the two main and a real shame that we missed the rest of these slides because they were quite informative but the majority of the information about what we're doing here with the Finney and the release is is in this and I can release the slides to people that that want to take a look at them so Finney is open and at to follow on with this this presentation I thought that it would be great to open Finney and give people the documentation to start playing with it so you can use it if you're on a computer right now you can connect to Finney and why don't I just show people how that's done so so if you can see my screen we're all good and you're at my terminal here Alec please give me a thumbs up yep then right so so developers out there if you want to connect to Finney you have to be on the Finney branch so this is Finney right here so you have to pull you have to pull this Branch from from Master with inside your potential directory and reinstall it so I recommend reinstalling with python and this will get you totally connected into everything that we're working with on finish so registration these networks are open so for instance if we were to run a metagraph you'll see there's three networks to choose from zero one and two right now these are just new numbered but they will be ascii-based in the future we'll actually have a a monogram for them so there's Network zero one and two and each one of these networks has about 4 000 uids in them each so we've with Finney just on the on the on the test Network we already have three times as many uids and we want people to register into these networks right now and really really test the out of what we've built we want people to break we've built on Finney so when they have one uid now this is maybe a little bit like those early days when there was only a couple uids and the first time we presented an open Network on on on bit tensor it was at 100 uids by the end of the call so I highly doubt that that will happen today but there's a there's a couple other things that I'd want to showcase here with the Kali that are open for people to do so one of them is is nomination so you can nominate yourself to be someone who can accept who can accept funds through delegated of stake and you simply need to call BT clean nominate and then you need to share your your address with people so when we launch Finney on kusama or polka dot we'll we will show what Foundation address people can use and that'll be available within the code so if people want to delegate stake to us and so we can take an 18 set of so to speak tax on on the dividends we'll be very very glad for that because we can use it to continue funding development but if you want to build your own organization delegating stake will be the beginning of how how we move forward with building those organizations so basically delegate is the other command which you can call and you simply passed let's let's see list delegates so as you can see the the key that I've nominated is here and can accept a delegation from other peers other hotkeys on their code because it's important to remember that it's the cold key itself that is performing the delegation right now I we've fixed the take to just under 18 so it's 17 9999 and I'm sure there's people that have questions about exactly how that that's going to play out and the Network's open and so people are welcome to to to get on Finney and and continue playing with it we hope we do play with it and and break it for us honestly and that's that's basically it that showcases you know the two extra additions to the to the code base for now and maybe we'll break to to questions at this point now yeah I think there's good okay I'm exciting will validators be able to adjust the take not sure what you mean by that Mike can I clarify a little bit yeah I know say what he means I know so so we we've fixed the take on purpose and instead we want competition to to occur at the level of awards that each of the Val each of the delegates is is accruing to their their their delegators through validation so if you have a hotkey that you've delegated to in that and that minor is not actually validating correctly inside bit tensor you'll see that affected in your returns as somebody delegating stake so the the fee is the same it's fixed across the board it's what the delegates can use that for how they can use that stake that will make the difference between which pool you want to join when can we expect mainnet within your launch I think you probably expect it more towards the end of q1 is the idea that small holders get a cut of the dividend awarded to validity too yes that's exactly right that new guy the idea is that your small tile holders will get a cover dividend the developerator will be getting can a validator reject statement from second you'll get you'll get the proportion of that validators dividends which would reflect the amount of stake that you've staked into that validator so as an example if there is a delegate with a hundred stake from me and that's it then I'll get I should get a hundred percent of the dividends that that that delegate is making minus an 18 take so they'll take 18 off the top they'll take 18 tokens let's say they made 100 Tau they'll take the first 18 and then the rest the night the rest the rest of the 82 will go directly to me yeah Alice you want to continue I thought original plan was to build their own validators to access the network and limiting validators to 100 are you also limiting the number of businesses to 100. well we have a limitation that's based per Network so we can have songs that have which which have more or less validators so it really depends on what the networks are working on and whether or not we want them to to be have larger validator sets or smaller validator sets it's something we can we can pick specifically for each Network [Music] I could probably answer this one so I'm not sure if anybody's kind of been keeping up with the kusama auctions but there was a bit of a hiccup on our side of the summer auction and what ended up happening is we're now on the current one that will be ending I believe on Thursday so when that's available we'll be going on to like we'll be we'll own that that slots and what we're going to do at that point is we're gonna test on this last month's weekend and then we'll provide an update whether we are going to be launching on kusama right away or on polka dot the reason for that is because the polka dot slot opens on February 13th anyways which is coming up four weeks give or take so we might just launch a joke around polka dot and skip the entire course set up all together our rewards automatically distributed yes yes well Nakamoto may not be dismissed or not now commodity main net is sticking around it's not going anywhere for the time being until we launch fully on polka dot we'll continue running so nothing will change there what does this time I look like for stepping into Finney and how does it go from here any testing tests approved factors Infinity are you a decreases on that timeline also are different so yes as mentioned kators the accountant basically is that we just launched what is this the soft launcher we're going to see how it performs on Roku Pro this Roku has actually been hosted by us entirely so if something goes down or entire thing breaks down it's probably fine nothing in the world then as we get closer to the polka dot lease period so our polka dot links begins February 13th we're actually going to be going through a lot of evaluations including on kusama and polka dots kind of double check and make sure that we are going to be able to safely onboard everybody over including their balances their registrations and kind of literally take a snapshot from the last block on Nakamoto onto the first block of infinity once we get that process down we're going to have a much more concrete update for you on one version into it but so far it looks rather promising that we should be able to hit our goal for for corporate and then as for your question about the uid increases on that timeline I think constants are probably more on that side than I am so I'll give you an update on that as we go let's see we'll leave 100 thresholds go live in two days before end of q1 so it'll be more like whenever we launched polka dot so Finney does go live with polka dots at one not in two days in today's really the only the only difference is we're just going to have a croissant slot that we're going to start testing on it but that's about it and obviously we were not going to be moving anything over without in front of the community so once we have a more once we know exactly how they're going to go either it's going to be sorry Mr Z either it's going to be polka dots or if it's going to be for summer we will let you know but for now as mentioned nothing changes on Nakamoto Nakamoto is going to say the same we are going to be either launched on kusama or polka dot depending on how this mini soft launch goes so we'll be providing regular updates weekly seeing how everything goes and then we'll go from there and yes laptop a lot of caffeine today so I apologies for being a little bit wired say Cox is asking how to become a top 100 validator just take the command or what are you gonna say it again to become a top 100 validator it's just steak for now right so this is this is the aspect where people if they want to become a validator they need to collect Tau from people that are willing to delegate it to them so that aspect is a little bit like Representatives seeking votes Alan next question let's see was just asking do you mean end of Q on March 31st or February basically we're aiming for Mid Feb unless something catastrophic happens or enough so when we're supposed to March only until so ideally fingers crossed to keep us in your prayers can I just issue raised by Elder J about open cancer team validators we will address this in the coming week to be frank with everybody we have been heads down on this launch for a long time and now we're going to kind of go back to regular business as well as maintaining standby for that is there slashing if a node goes down you know even by slashing constantly I I think it's it's really just the same way it's been all this time like if your node goes down then and you're a minor you'll you'll be slashed by the validators of course if you're a validator that's had a bunch of steak pooled to you and you're performing badly because you've gone down you can imagine that people will pull their stake so it's important for validators to stay up long stay up online if they want a track investment to we mentioned that the idea is to incentivize validators to compete for delegations by optimizing to validate better than the competition will there be more information on how validators can be optimized slash paid repetitive yeah so yeah there's there's a number of ways that we want to introduce competition between these validators I mean and and and one of them is that we want validator pools they exist to showcase that they're using that take that 18 to actually benefit the network right so you know the foundation is creating our key and and we're going to be you know outputting a lot of work from the funds that we make right so we would hope that people that that invest in in other pools or expect the same performance from their their validator pool that they actually perform necessary duties in the network so that's what I meant by introducing a sort of a government's layer into into bit tensor and we're going to work hard to make sure that that's Visual and transparent people and how that works right now it's just it's just really okay how much money is is this validator making for me the the smart the margins but invaliders is is actually not that high they won't be that that big of a difference between validators so it will be you know minor percentage points as far as we can see so we're not hoping we're not we're not looking for people to to say find a way to to create better validators right now or more more looking for people to to pool stake as a way of building organizations cool mrzy's asking are we safe on Nakamoto until February or polka dot lunch yes you are completely safe on Nakamoto unless otherwise stated so that means that until we make an announcement about it does not change there's still debating that everything else Finney is a test net the one thing to keep in mind for everybody here though is that we will be winding down Nobunaga in the coming weeks I will post up and announcement about it as we do it but Nobunaga is becoming obsolete in the next couple days is a test net so it doesn't make much difference so to be a validator you are an active manager an engineer with a focused Vision how you want machine learning to be hang on maybe I've had too much coffee so to be a validator you are an active manager and engineer with a focused vision of how you want machine learning to be basically kind of yeah so as a validator you have a bit of kind of a dude to make sure that the direction of the tensor takes is the one that a that your delegates agree with and B that is good for the network to kind of have to walk that line yeah how many registrations will be on Finney at live launch there will be 4096 registrations on the Nakamoto clone so everybody's stake their balances across the network and their uids will will be fixed and deep copy from from the current Nakamoto so it'll look exactly the same and feel exactly the same as Nakamoto all the hyper parameters will be the same it will be what you expect if nothing were to change really but Finney will also have other networks on that same same chain so that will be exciting so there'll be other places for people to register and we may open it up immediately with a 16k registration Network so that in order to get into Nakamoto after the launch you'll need to perform well on this registration Network to do so so like it will will reduce the difficulty for registration on Nakamoto because people have to perform well in this registration Network first correct if the validator is out to the top 100 would their key get be registered too yes it it it can yeah it can't it once it's out of the top 100 it falls under the same deregistration the same deregistration issue as others however you don't immediately lose dividends you still maintain your dividends while you have bonds so basically is a slow decay of your dividends to zero at which point you're still performing well and you're not going to be pruned for the network so there's there's slight differences there in the way in which we're pruning notes that people can read in the code and I think you'll you'll you'll see this it's much better than it was before in Nakamoto well you guys created easier way to stick a user interface yeah this would be really easy because the way we built delegation is that you you don't even need a hotkey so you don't need to register anything you just need a normal bit tensor wallet and delegating could be just a single click on a number of wallet so we could we could for instance and we intend to add the ability to delegate stake as something something that's integrated right into our wallet that's going to be on the on the website so people will be able to just hold if they're holding towel they can immediately immediately delegate and and pull those tokens down whenever they need to cool Mr Paco requires more more preparation can we explain why pow is still necessary so Mr Paco kind of it's a good kind of give a bit of History lesson here when we first started with tensor the idea behind the group of work was to be a form of civil resistance to kind of keep people from deploying too many minors and kind of just going nuts and flooding the network what it kind of evolved to as well as civil resistance is basically a form to say that you have the compute to participate in the network right you know I was coming in with you know some small Raspberry Pi coming in with something that's powerful enough to actually run the models that are required to enable the tensor to grow now you were asking somebody that if it was you I'm not sure who was but somebody was asking earlier if P if a proof work will still be necessary once we go on Penny and and I explained that it is but it's going to be less intense so less intense meaning because it could be more uids and more sub networks it's going to be a little bit less crazy than it is now you're not going to have like a you know 100 trillion difficulty anymore but it's not necessary because it does still allow us to kind of have a form of school resistance and a form to identify that this person is able to run the models that are required foreign launch or is it staying peer-to-peer no comments yeah no comments we can't really comment on this at all because this is yeah let's see okay again heavy Stacks I'm pretty sure I answered your question earlier you were asking personal planners build their own validators check the network and limiting goddess 100 but you're also on English it's 100 constantly answered this already just because there's so many questions you can feel free to go through the reporting later index when can we expect increasing your view IDs on any more or less of course not exactly as you mentioned earlier was it upon launch or a little bit after launch taken yeah a bit excellent yeah but after launch you can expect that increase the breakdown of what we will use the 18 for exactly yeah so go for that one I mean what the foundation yeah so I mean what we intend to use the 18 for I think that's that's a whole other conversation but we can touch into it so the foundation like the developers that are behind the scenes building bit tensor right now or committing most of the work into the repo are funded by early day miners primarily Allen myself Who Sold Tau in order to fund the non-profit in Canada to hire Engineers to continue developing a bit tense or so in order to continue that organization moving forward we want to we wanted to build a mechanism for us to fund it and without having to actually give up Tau directly so to solve our own problem we built delegation really so that there was a way for us to delegate State into a shared pool and then use some of those funds over time to fund the development to fund Engineers researching and building on top of the protocol we didn't want to just make that for us right because that would just be centralized in the foundation so we built it so that it was competitive so that other people can do the same thing so if there's other people in the in the community who want to build a a pool and and take 18 from that pool so they can find a bit tensor and projects on top of the tensor we want to see that we think that that's the best route forward for for the whole system and and that's what we're hoping that people do and that's where the 18 will go so the 18 will hopefully go to you know funding these organizations and their ability to to help us continue with our mission here if they've been immunity period for those uids that would have been copied so they don't get deregistered before incentive has been built yeah so what we're going to do is we're going to do a big difficulty and difficulty will be like 190 trillion and there won't be it won't be possible for people to to register given that the Network's limit is right around 41 trillion so the the trickle end of new registrations will happen very slowly until the difficulty adjustment pulls it down and then there'll be normal registration so you'll have time and depending on what number we pick you'll have more or less time we haven't really figured out exactly what that's going to be if you're going to have a week or two weeks or two weeks um we'll we're also going to open up two networks likely at the same time so Nakamoto will not be the only game in town are we talking to the team from thousand wallets their solution after getting polka dots yes chatter has started but we haven't actually learned anything yet so I'd rather not kind of dig into more details there when will sequence length be increased and will flash be integrated to reduce number usage before the next increase all right what flash flash attention yeah plus attention it's not on our priority right now to it's a maybe Carol says maybe because it's not a high priority for us to get flash attention in board if you know and and as numerous times before it's if you think that's a competitive Advantage for your miners I I recommend implementing it faster than us because you know it's in our interest to to make faster Miners and the better the network but in a way it's more in your interest to do that faster than us so we we welcome open source contributions to the miners bitters validator spots by a single entity all right so I think the same way in this thing yeah so I mean I mean that would really come down to how much tile you have if you have all the towel then you do that you could take all 100 slots yeah exactly and so that that is an issue and but in doing so it's a little difficult right because you know let's say that you do have there's very few people that have enough chocolate 100 slots and stay competitive in all the 100 spots right it's gonna be brother hard to keep that up and after a while it's gonna get harder and harder and harder as the network grows as More Cows being accumulated yeah hundreds also 100 is also just we threw that number out it's you know on Nakamoto right now we have over 200 right so we don't intend to to to to make it a small number like 100 anytime soon just to start really really what stops everyone from just seven percent across the board people are welcome to do that I mean I think the the point is that that when you delegate your stake you want to make sure that that those funds are being used to improve the network and people should do the due diligence about who they're staking to correct you know it's always you can always take somebody with a lot of with a lot of Tau and that's perfectly fine but at the end of the day if that towel is not being used to improve the network then really it's it's kind of a self-defeating purposes right so this is also kind of an incentive mechanism for some teams to join big tensor as well so developing on it and kind of be funded to do that too so it's kind of incentivizing open source development what are your thoughts as a restriction as a service where people saw a huge compute for getting hotkeys registered quickly and it's a rather interesting business but we haven't really dug into it yet what's the question the question is whether or not we've looked into the business what are your thoughts on restrictions yeah where people sell huge compute for getting honkies really quickly I you can do it again you you I mean I don't know if it's been done but but you can do it and it's it's something that the protocol allows because you can make the registration call from a key that that is not the one that's being registered so you don't even need to give them the hotkeys in order to do that registration and that's that's actually built right into the base layer if you want to use it extra service I mean we were watching that pretty close foreign we'll have the same transfer fee of 0.125 I know it's down no no no it's dropped by a hundred fold it's it's 100 fold smaller okay sounds good cool I feel better yeah did you know when Ledger compatibility will be we haven't looked into that quite yet but probably will be sometime in two three two four I'd say maybe even sooner like I might be on the call but he was saying that that we may even have the integration now if you do a little bit of wiggling around with the polka dot JS extension which can hold our token this ledger works directly with that I believe yeah but but I mean we're we're not working on Ledger Ledger integration directly yeah it's a great idea it's it's yeah give it some time 18 will go to the delegator you stake with right so for someone if somebody is sick Mike is noted then 18 goes to Mike or goes to the foundation it goes to Mike so no no no inverse inverse inverse inverse 18 goes to the Val to the validator so the foundation yeah so that's that's what that was a question right it's like if somebody sticks with Mike on his note okay so yeah so unless you're sticking with the foundation it won't go to the foundation basically right yeah exactly so you have to you have to delegate stake to the foundation minor yeah in order for the foundation to take the 18 stake take the 18 is for the delegator sorry it's for the validator so the validator yeah yeah exactly so just to confirm was the 800 100 is an example or the plan limit it's it's an initial limit I think Investments more than anything it's not something that is going to be a hard limit and it's not something that's just going to be we're stuck with which is something that we've started there as a start how many different bit times your foundation about there's either to choose from at launch or initial competition we don't have a number on that yet we will share that with you as soon as we do as soon as we start moving forward on I don't watch yourself we'll have all those details for you already we're caught up on questions so far folks for anybody well I guess everybody's here but if there's anyone asking you if they weren't part of this chat feel free to let them know that we're going to be uploading the video as well as the slides uh in the next 24 hours awesome okay Lama was asking again one of the next sequence like no doubt or before nothing nothing planned nothing planets we're gonna wait for for basically the network to reach an equilibrium before we start hitting with increases like that we might also create sub networks that have we can and we will actually create sub networks that have different sequence likes Etc so they'll they'll be you know some places where you don't need sequence lengths and others so you do and and people can choose to work between those those consistent mechanisms yeah foreign States numbers for the validators fairly decent time ahead because we still have a little bit of time before launch in Feb if we do do that and we still have quite a bit fantastic to do on Vinnie with you guys as well so please use the Halal City and run it to the ground we want to see what happens because we don't we want this book about launch to the s means it can be hence the soft launch today is anybody registered I haven't seen anyone yet let's let's see I expected already caliori says he can't use metagraph orphany okay well we'll get into Technical and no some people are registering I I I'm actually seeing I'm seeing six on network zero so that's great so things are off and people are registering that's awesome yeah okay so there's still more questions coming here could we make a network of any channel yes absolutely we can let's do that right after this call my understanding is that if any will be on poker dot orchestone on both is there any scenario where there will be two economic potential networks running simultaneously one on kusama and one within the more stable copious on polka dot no plans to we don't want to have two incentivized networks we think they were just complex things and complexify things so we're just going to keep it pretty simple future on kusama and polka dot the kusama yeah yeah possibly we do do that yeah yeah if we go that direction oh cool right on time again very long time fantastic I said I think are the questions flowing in or is that it I think maybe we should end the call I think we're good we're good to end it Jacqueline and I will work on the video get it done and upload it to you guys by tomorrow ideally fantastic okay thank you everyone I'm really glad to
