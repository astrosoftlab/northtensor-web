# Roadmap

&nbsp;

There's a lot that needs to be done to get Bittensor more widely recognized, utilized, and accepted. Our charter is to lay a foundation that will support a smoother on-ramp to inspire a builder culture that leverages Bittensor to solve the world's problems, great and small.

In order to achieve this, we've sketched out the below strategy we're moving towards.

&nbsp;

#### 1. Bittensor Documentation and Resources

We aim to support and incentivize the community in building out comprehensive resources so people can get ramped up quickly onto Bittensor.

Having easy to follow, step-by-step documentation from zero to developing or mining is important to have. If people can't figure out how to even install the software, they'll never get to see the fun of using it.

Specifically,

* **Guides**: We'll be writing requested guides from scratch and supporting bounties for guides, explainers, or whatever else the community feels could help. We aim to use the staking fee to pay out bounties.
* **Documentation**: If you don't have experience with substrate, crypto technology, machine learning, and all the other very narrow specializations, you're going to have a hard time ramping. Even harder is the small overlap of developers that both know crypto and machine learning. We'll provide (and support) documentation on the tools, processes, and technologies, for those coming from Data Science or from Crypto.
* **Resources Bot**: We'd be doing Bittensor a disservice if we weren't using it to support its own development. We're working on collating data and fine-tuning models on that data to create a solution that can be more expert on Bittensor. Funds staked will go towards its development and hosting on the network people users to query and utilize its intelligence.

&nbsp;
#### 2. Marketing and Outreach

For Bittensor to succeed, it needs demand and users which doesn't come naturally. OpenTensor developers only have so much bandwidth, we're hoping to help scale out the marketing, advertising, and exposure by leveraging community funding and support.

We've had a small team working behind-the-scenes on marketing and outreach for Bittensor adoption with wide success on adoption, now we're aiming to use our network to ramp up and bring more attention to its power, getting it into more users hands.

Activities we're hoping to ramp:

* **Presentations**: Sessions in target markets to expose developers that are interested in the new AI-craze and how Bittensor can act as a decentralized solution to give them more intelligence per dollar than majority of solutions on the market today.
* **Advertising**: Will leverage staking fees towards advertising as reviewed and taking feedback from the community on messaging, format, and launch.
* **Networking Opportunities**: Events funded by the community to get like-minded developers together to talk projects, strategies, and team up on solutions

&nbsp;
#### 3. Tools, APIs, and Experimentation

Bittensor needs to be accessible to a broad base of users, including miners, stakers, developers, and even clients. We want to make it easy for all of them to dive into these options.

We've been working on various solutions to simplify on-ramp and utilization of Bittensor, and plan to tie that into our community.

&nbsp;

Planned tools today include:

1. **Frontend to easily train or fine-tune models**, experiment with results, and launch onto mining for Tao to serve the network (we see this as a great potential to get Data Scientists using Bittensor to subsidize their development costs while growing the intelligence of the network)
2. **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) incentivized with Tao rewards**. For an intelligent model, we need intelligent people providing feedback, we hope to provide a tool to enable RLHF on our platform with distributed rewards for helping support the models.
3. Client-level front-ends to leverage Bittensor data. We want to make sure the models are being used, so select stakers and clients will be able to use the Bittensor network directly through our site for inspiration and deployment.

&nbsp;

Feel free to provide more feedback on our community space on Discord.

We're community driven, so we're very interested in distributing any Tao rewards to those that are helping drive Bittensor forward.
